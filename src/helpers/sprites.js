    <h2>Client -Royal Bank Of Canada</h2>
    <p>
    I proudly showcase my extensive work experience in web application development within the fintech domain, particularly with RBC Bank. As a key member of the team, I successfully managed the credit application, demonstrating proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies using Angular and Node.js. My responsibilities extended to leading a talented team of 5 to 6 members, including an offshore team, where I took charge as a tech lead, fostering trust and camaraderie. My day-to-day involved a harmonious blend of leadership (60%) and hands-on coding (40%) for full-stack development. Working with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL, I effectively integrated GraphQL, deploying the application through a seamless Jenkins pipeline. It's a testament to my capabilities in overseeing complex projects and delivering exceptional results.

    <h2>Client - Citi Bank</h2>
    <p>
    I highlight my successful project with Citibank, where I played a crucial role in developing the credit application for the Singapore and Hong Kong markets. My responsibilities encompassed managing the "replace" and "report lost" modules for various markets, diligently handling tickets and bugs on a daily basis. I took pride in implementing accessibility features across the application, along with enhancing test cases. As a lead, I effectively guided a team of five members, leading a backend project focused on retrieving user data reports. For this project, I utilized React and Node.js, and also worked with our in-house Angular-based framework, known as ODC. The experience has been immensely rewarding, and I cherish the opportunity to contribute to this impactful project.

    <h2>Product - Telegro</h2>
    <p>
    I am thrilled to showcase my outstanding work on the Telegro project. Telegro is an innovative study-based platform that offers engaging courses with video content from expert instructors. As the lead developer, I successfully implemented a secure payment gateway using PayPal, allowing users to conveniently access and watch instructor videos. I introduced exciting additional features. Users can now connect with instructors through video calls by paying a nominal fee, schedule one-on-one classes, and even participate in live sessions. To achieve seamless video calling and messaging, I skillfully integrated WebRTC and Socket.io, ensuring a smooth and interactive communication experience.

    <h2>Client - Uber</h2>
    <p>
    I am excited to showcase my instrumental role in the groundbreaking "Uber for Uber" project. As Uber delved into driverless car technology, our team developed a cutting-edge in-house application to support their vision. This application leverages machine learning, Angular, and Node.js to process images and input data, precisely detecting pedestrians and identifying their actions - whether walking, standing, or crossing the road.
    With great attention to detail, we ensured the application could identify and categorize every object on the road accurately. To streamline the data collection process, the operation team utilized the application to upload images and apply essential markings for training the machine learning algorithms.
